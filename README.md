IPED is Portuguese: Indexador e Processador de EvidÃªncias Digitais.

In English: Digital Evidence Processor and Indexer. It is a tool implemented in java and originally and still developed by digital forensic experts from Brazilian Federal Police since 2012. 
Although it was always meant to be open source, its source code was effectively made public in 2019.


The source code and documentation is currently hosted at [IPED](https://github.com/sepinf-inc/IPED).
